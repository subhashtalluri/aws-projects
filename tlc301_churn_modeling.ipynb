    "## Background\n",
    "Customer churn is a business challenge that all Communication Service Providers encounter on a daily basis. The goal of this machine learning notebook is to look at historical data from the network, subscribed products, usage, and pricing to predict the conditions under which a particular customer is likely to churn.The steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preparing your Amazon SageMaker notebook\n",
    "* Downloading data from S3 into Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "* Investigating and transforming the data so that it can be fed to Amazon SageMaker algorithms\n",
    "* Estimating a model using the Gradient Boosting algorithm\n",
    "* Evaluating the effectiveness of the model\n",
    "* Setting the model up to make on-going predictions\n",

    "_This notebook was created and tested on an ml.m4.xlarge notebook instance._\n",

    "Let's start by specifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The S3 bucket and prefix that you want to use for training and model data.  This should be within the same region as the Notebook Instance, training, and hosting.\n",
    "- The IAM role arn used to give training and hosting access to your data. See the documentation for how to create these.  Note, if more than one role is required for notebook instances, training, and/or hosting, please replace the boto regexp with a the appropriate full IAM role arn string(s)."

    "When building a model whose primary goal is to predict a target value on new data, it is important to understand overfitting.  Supervised learning models are designed to minimize error between their predictions of the target value and actuals, in the data they are given.  This last part is key, as frequently in their quest for greater accuracy, machine learning models bias themselves toward picking up on minor idiosyncrasies within the data they are shown.  These idiosyncrasies then don't repeat themselves in subsequent data, meaning those predictions can actually be made less accurate, at the expense of more accurate predictions in the training phase.\n",

    "The most common way of preventing this is to build models with the concept that a model shouldn't only be judged on its fit to the data it was trained on, but also on \"new\" data.  There are several different ways of operationalizing this, holdout validation, cross-validation, leave-one-out validation, etc.  For our purposes, we'll simply randomly split the data into 3 uneven groups.  The model will be trained on 70% of data, it will then be evaluated on 20% of data to give us an estimate of the accuracy we hope to have on \"new\" data, and 10% will be held back as a final testing dataset which will be used later on."

Taken together, these aspects make gradient boosted trees a good candidate algorithm.\n",

In order to improve predictive accuracy further, we could tweak value we threshold our predictions at to alter the mix of false-positives and false-negatives, or we could explore techniques like hyperparameter tuning.
